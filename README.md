# Ghetto Links

My old bookmarking site stopped working, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it
ðŸ˜“ (3rd party PHP which I had previously installed by following their
instructions, and it hasn't been updated for years.)

I started working on a replacement with a nice modern architecture... But it was
taking too long and I need access to my bookmarks dammit.

So here's a quick hack with the oldest web architecture. It uses the database of
the original system.

## TODO

- Frontend code for searching. (The backend handles it already)
- Pagination controls. (I'm not sure how important, I mean if you have more than
  a page of results maybe you need to narrow your search.)
- Add new links.
